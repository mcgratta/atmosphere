{\bf Response to comments by Reviewer of Revision 2}
\end{center}

Compared to the last review, no noticeable improvements can be expected for this work at this stage, even if further enhancements can be considered in future works (in particular RoS modelling and calibration for the level set method).

Only second order remarks remain:

- Non erased text line 227

\hl{This paragraph was reworked and the extra words removed.}


- References missing near lines 298, 403, 407

\hl{Fixed}


- line 312: gas-phase instead of gas-phased ?

\hl{Correct, fixed.}

- Figures indicated as 5, 6, 7, 8 which do not correspond to the actual figures. A figure is probably missing.

\hl{Fixed}

- More problematic: the RoS estimated by the lagrangian method reported in Table 1 do not seem to correspond to those of Fig 5, and to the description in the text.

\hl{Correct, somehow the column headers were swapped. The problem of multiple authors working at home. Things are now fixed.}
